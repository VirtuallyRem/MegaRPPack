 #RAKH
 r_rakh: "Rakh Gene-Tailoring Tools "
 r_rakh_desc: "These tools represent some of the finest artifice of the Rakh Empire, and easily untwist the skein of even fungoid genetics without undue difficulty. Their purpose is incomplete; a full collection of such would allow for biochemical malleability of immense potential."
 rakh_relic_active: "Rakh Genetic's Implemented"
 rakh.01.name: "Rakh Utility"
 rakh.01.desc: "The recovered tool's from the ancient Rakh empire are tailored for quick genetic altering. While we use them, we should be able to quickly modify whole species within a few months."
 rakh_digsite: "An ancient cache"
 rakh_digsite_desc: "This cache appears to be safely secured behind high pressure security doors. Opening it will take substantial effort and great care, so as not to destroy everything within."
 rakh.11.name: "An Azure Dream"
 rakh.11.desc: "he cache has been opened...partially. A single item has been retrieved, a lengthy wand of blue colour. It is apparently utilised to assess bio-compatibility, as two of our scientists holding it caused it to glow magenta."
 rakh.11.a: "Magenta? Groovy."
 rakh.12.name: "Red Sands"
 rakh.12.desc: "Another item has been successfully discovered and marked. This takes the appearance of a vial full of red sand. The sand’s purpose involves tempering genetic functions before the tailoring can begin. We have deduced how to make it, as well!"
 rakh.12.a: "Sand-based tech? Novel."
 rakh.13.name: "Training"
 rakh.13.desc: "One of the items eluded us until we retrieved an ancient training manual. The squat iron orb is in fact a Rakh bio-monitor, which seems to have been commonly embedded against their spine. We have hooked it to one of our monitors; the technology is cross-compatible."
 rakh.13.a: "Reticulating spines…"
 rakh.14.name: "Hindsight is 40/40"
 rakh.14.desc: "The Rakh apparently categorised all genetic typology into forty categories, which are now being utilised as nomenclature. Their writings are extensive, and the cache contains genetic samples representative of all forty. Well, thirty nine now. Accidents happen. The scientist in question has been...disciplined."
 rakh.14.a: "As well they should be!"
 rakh.15.name: "A Keen Edge"
 rakh.15.desc: "The Rakh prize their blades. What we had thought had been simply a sort of large knife is in fact a metaphor; the thing is actually a key to a deeper lock. We just need to figure out exactly how to use it! Knifework is hard."
 rakh.15.a: "Knifework is also sharp. Ouch."
 rakh.16.name: "Gotta Catch ‘em all"
 rakh.16.desc: "The last part of the cache has been unlocked via the Knife. Inside is a vast array of samples and completely pristine equipment. It appears that the Rakh, in their great cyclical history - which some of our archaeologists theorise may have taken place across galaxies - have collected countless alien samples. This has revolutionised our understanding of biological sciences, and the Rakh’s great obsession - biological enhancement - has gifted us with many helpful medical techniques. There is no sign, however, of what happened to the ancient Rakh - nor in the results of their potent techniques being applied."
 rakh.16.a: "What a grand and intoxicating display…"

 #PLISAN 
 r_plisan: "Plisan Data-disc"
 r_plisan_desc: "A remaining semi-sentient Data-disc surviving the purge, containing valuable blueprints of the Superior Plisan Engineering."
 plisan.01.name: "Data-disc Deciphered"
 plisan.01.desc: "Information from the data-disc is proving extremely useful for space based habitation."
 relic_plisan_active:1 "§HUnlocks Decision:§! §G$decision_plisan$§!, granting the ability to increase one $pc_habitat$ by two districts and unlock the $tech_habitat_1$ tech if not researched."
 plisan_digsite: "Field of Ruin"
 plisan_digsite_desc: "Scanning the celestial body shows signs of debris of large metal constructions over the entire half of it, but oddly absent from the other half. Further Investigation needed."
 plisan.11.name: "Megastructure Remnants"
 plisan.11.desc: "It appears that the debris scattered along the planetside was once one incredibly large structure that crashed onto the planet ages ago, spreading debris all over the planetside as it went down."
 plisan.11.a: "Interesting"
 plisan.12.name: "Habitable Station"
 plisan.12.desc: "Further digging into the largest piece of the structure found shows that this was once a station built for long term habitation, spanning generations. Not unlike a regular habitat, but on a much much larger scale."
 plisan.12.a: "Incredible"
 plisan.13.name: "Setback?"
 plisan.13.desc: "A large amount of Data-discs have been recovered from the Ruins making it likely that every single individual had their personal one, but further investigations show that all of them are destroyed beyond repair. The destruction of the discs seem to even outdate the crash and was done deliberately."
 plisan.13.a: "We must find out more"
 plisan.14.name: "Identity"
 plisan.14.desc: "Through a few written records found well preserved inside a vault deep inside the ship, it appears an order was sent out well before the crash to all ''Plisans'' living in the Station to destroy the Data-discs and other valuable tech to prevent the unworthy aggressors from obtaining the ''Superior Plisan Engineering''. From the text we can see that this species were highly protective of their secrets."
 plisan.14.a: "Let's find these secrets"
 plisan.15.name: "The Core"
 plisan.15.desc: "Our scientists manage to locate the core of the ancient megastructure! What we found was a well preserved Mammalian skeleton with limbs and organs replaced with machinery wired into the very core of the station. It seems like this was a leader of the Plisans, and all the technology in this room was set to self destruct well before the crash happened. It appears this entity killed himself just slightly after sending the order to destroy all technology. It appears he was no exception to the rules."
 plisan.15.a: "Horrifying!"
 plisan.16.name: "The folly of the Plisans"
 plisan.16.desc: "Just when we were about to give up, we found one remaining Data-disc remaining undestroyed. Somehow it’s owner, a Plisan named Tsa-Go, had ignored the orders to destroy it and clearly had plans to try to escape the habitat. There are records of the Plisan Administration, a spaceborn species that have traveled galaxies only to find our galaxy their new home. Lead by their immortal Administrator wired up to the core of their largest station they were a small but technologically highly advanced species. In face of a threat that would destroy them, the Administrator decided to purge all Plisan technology to prevent the aggressors from getting their hands on it. When the attack never came, the large station that had lost too much of it’s important technology crashed on the celestial body it rotated."
 plisan.16.a: "What fools. Their own paranoia became their end."
 relic_plisan_activated: "Activated data-disc"
 relic_plisan_expansion: "Plisan Expansion"
 decision_plisan: "Plisan data-disc expansion"
 decision_plisan_desc: "Utilizing data from the data-disc, we can increase the size of one $pc_habitat$"

 #TSAGOTH 
 r_tsagoth_bone_chimes: "Tsagoth Bone Chimes"
 r_tsagoth_bone_chimes_desc: "The sound of these wind chimes fills the listener with hatred and murderous intent. (You could swear it whispers to you to commit bodily harm onto xenos)"
 tsagoth_relic_active: "Tsagoth Hatred"
 tsagoth.01.name: "Sounding the chimes"
 tsagoth.01.desc: "The sound of the chimes is heard by all. Those who are not already consumed by xenophobia begin to have nightmares. Filled with violence and cruelty. Those already consumed by it feel almost euphoric listening to the earie chimes."
 relic_tsagoth_active:0 "Gain up to 3 years worth of unity, depending on how xenophobic your empire is."
 tsagoth_digsite: "Stasis Field"
 tsagoth_digsite_desc: "Our scientists have found an ancient curating vault locked behind an extremely powerful stasis field. Cracking it open may now be possible, as it has weakened with age, but once upon a time it must have been nigh-invulnerable. There is no sign of who made it or why."
 tsagoth.11.name: "An ossuary"
 tsagoth.11.desc: "Our scientists have discovered a grisly spectacle. Ranks upon ranks of bones, most yellowed with age; of countless unknown alien species. It will take some time to decipher what this place is and its purpose."
 tsagoth.11.a: "Gastly. Let's keep digging."
 tsagoth.12.name: "Additional findings"
 tsagoth.12.desc: "Further investigation has revealed a small group of mummified - or rather, desiccated - individuals of molluscoid origin. These molluscoids are dressed in tight wetsuits, and have octopoid-like heads, though their tentacles are razored. They also bear cybernetic implants."
 tsagoth.12.a: "We must find out more."
 tsagoth.13.name: "Scripture"
 tsagoth.13.desc: "Examination has found a small data-library at the back of the vault, along with a great deal of alien writing. Initial reports claim that the creatures here are ''Tsagoth'' with no explanation; the vault is apparently the work of the ''Arboreans''. Further investigation is clearly needed!"
 tsagoth.13.a: "Fascinating."
 tsagoth.14.name: "Dark Deeds"
 tsagoth.14.desc: " The bones have been assessed while our scientists collate the data-library. Almost all of the bones have been sucked of marrow, and bear visible damage consistent with the molluscoid’s mouths, hands, and in a number of cases, feet. The bones range across at least six different sapient (judging by form, skull capacity, teeth, etc) species. Some of bones clearly belong to juveniles. Some have been formed into artistic wind-chimes, which have given many of the junior scientists nightmares."
 tsagoth.14.a: "Horrifying."
 tsagoth.15.name: "Frantic scribblings"
 tsagoth.15.desc: "The data-library contains two sets of entries; one contains a warning from the Arboreans, which is being deciphered. The latter appears to be from the Tsagoth themselves, presumably the Molluscoids, who hacked into the device and edited one of its root functions. It appears to have previously been an operating manual, which they rewrote."
 tsagoth.15.a: "Decipher these entries"
 tsagoth.16.name: "The Last Testament of the Tsagoth"
 tsagoth.16.desc: "Full data-analysis has been accomplished. The Tsagoth were apparently a genocidal species of ancient times, who endured conditions - vacuum, immense cold, lack of UV light - which would otherwise have killed countless species. This hardiness, coupled with an utter ruthlessness, catapulted them to prominence. They arose, and then sought to destroy all life not of their own making. The Arboreans, allied with a technological species of plants whose name has been corrupted, along with a few other species, managed to wipe them out with ''pillars of ivory fire''. The few remaining Tsagoth were sealed within vaults with the bones of their victims, forced to confront their horrible crimes. They were unapologetic; their testament contains mocking descriptions of how much they enjoyed eating the Arborean's children when they overran their worlds in a last ditch assault during the war. A cookbook is included. The Tsagoth have also included an instruction on how to revive their hatred and violence, to implant their violence and hatred into the minds of other beings, making them devoid of any purpose save murder. Their only request is that they be permitted to kill, in the service of ''meat'', as the now corrupted soldiers see their own kind - purely out of spite towards the Arboreans and their allies, who preached a creed of pacifism."
 tsagoth.16.a: "..."

 #AKAHIA
 r_akahia: "Akahian Artillery Blueprint"
 r_akahia_desc: "The blueprints from the weapon that caused the downfall of Akahian society. The 2.3m cannon equipped on the C-84 Schiffsjäger was supposed to be an unstoppable force. Unfortunately this unstoppable force met an immovable object. Putting this weapon on larger ships though should prove effective"
 akahia_relic_active: "Utilising Akahian Blueprints"
 akahia.01.name: "Using the blueprints"
 akahia.01.desc: "Our engineers are analysing the blueprints, applying the designs to our kinetic weapons"
 akahia_digsite: "Signs of the Past"
 akahia_digsite_desc: "It looks like that there are traces of an old civilization on this planet. Surface scans show that metal structures peak out of the ground. We should investigate them."
 akahia.11.name: "Devastation"
 akahia.11.desc: "Further scans and exploratory flights reveal that the planet is littered with clearly unnatural craters of unimaginable size. We theorise that this civilization was on a modern technical level when it was hit by a meteor shower that whipped them out. Nothing else could explain these impacts."
 akahia.11.a: "What could have happened here?"
 akahia.12.name: "Curiosity"
 akahia.12.desc: "We started digging around one of the buildings. The architecture is very symmetrical and efficient. There is barely any decoration. It looks like these buildings were once huge skyscrapers but the centuries buried them."
 akahia.12.a: "What mysteries and stories might these ruins tell us?"
 akahia.13.name: "hey who lived here before"
 akahia.13.desc: "We found something that looked like living quarters. It was sealed air tight so some items inside could be recovered. A picture is showing multiple feathered beings. One in the middle is wearing a grey uniform and is surrounded by smaller ones. They all smile into the capturing device. We found something that looks like a gun but clearly is a toy and to our astonishment a device that looks like a datapad."
 akahia.13.a: "Let's try power it up."
 akahia.14.name: "Tragedy"
 akahia.14.desc: "We did it. We powered the pad and now after weeks of deciphering and with the help of some other relics we found we managed to translate parts of the language. Its the diary of one of the children called Maria. It tells the story of a great conflict that raged on for decades. The officer in the picture is called Erhard Sauer and this was the last picture taken of him before his departure against the “Enemy”. She writes that she and her father never knew peace. That generations perished in this war. Sadly she does not know anything more and the data is very corrupt. But we found some more rooms that look very important. "
 akahia.14.a: "Lets see what they have to tell us."
 akahia.15.name: "The Great War"
 akahia.15.desc: "The last few months were very fruitful. We know now most details about the conflict. It looks like the nation of Akahia, in whose ruins we now stand were attacked by another empire without any cause. In one first war they fought and kept them at a standstill but lost some small portion of their empire. But years later without any provocation the so called Pendulians came back and attacked again. The descriptions speak of masses of death robots that overran whole worlds, leaving no one alive. Their fleets were swarms that darkened the suns. Over time allies came and went and the whole thing evolved into a struggle of attrition. Worlds were lost, regained and lost again. Countless generations were born into war and death. After a hundred years they stopped counting losses and individuals became just numbers in the machines of war and the newest data is mostly specs for weapons, logistical manifests and production quotas. The last big debate was about the use of the so called 2,3 gun and if it should still be used."
 akahia.15.a: "We must find more about these weapons!"
 akahia.16.name: "Fate of a nation"
 akahia.16.desc: "We have it. In the ruins of a factory we found it. Blueprints and logs on the so called 2,3m gun. It is a marvelous piece of engineering. We do see some flaws in its targeting system but we are confident that we can improve upon this design. We even found out more about the war and its possible outcome. The log of an Admiral speaks about one mission that is called Morgenröte. It sounds like most resources of the last year were pulled into one last shot at, one push with a giant fleet into the heart of Pendulian space with a mission to wipe out their capital. To achieve this he writes that they have to open up nearly all fronts to the enemy and he hopes that they can reach Pendulia faster than the enemy realises what they are doing. He prays that the sacrifices will be worth it for the final victory. Well we don't know if they succeeded in destroying Pendulia, but it looks like that the enemy at least got here. We now know that the craters were not from asteroid impacts but originated by orbital bombardment. Our estimates say that no one survived. Lets hope that the akahian legacy can help us avoid any fate close to them."
 akahia.16.a: "These weapons and lesson's will provide invaluable."
