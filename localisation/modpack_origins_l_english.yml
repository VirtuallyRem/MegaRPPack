#Synth origin additional text
START_SCREEN_SYNTH_0: "As a specie, we always felt somewhat limited by our bodies; all throughout our history we tried to overcome these limitation through the use of technology, first by using simple devices such as glasses or dentures, then more sophisticated cybernetic implants and interfaces that allowed us to connect directly to our electronics and computers."

START_SCREEN_SYNTH_1_EGAL: "Eventually, we developed a way to transfer our very consciousness into robotic bodies, synthetics, that gave us complete mastership over our form. The vast majority of our population, recognizing the superiority of the new bodies, willingly underwent the transfering procedure and by the time the first faster-than-light probes were deployed, our entire specie was no more organic, but synthetic beings."

START_SCREEN_SYNTH_1_AUTH: "Eventually, we developed a way to transfer our very consciousness into robotic bodies, synthetics, that gave us complete mastership over our form. The social and economical upheaval that followed led to the rise of a caste of mechanical leaders who swiftly deposed the old governments and took power. In the name of progress and efficiency everyone was forced to undergo transition and by the time the first faster-than-light probes were deployed, our entire specie was no more organic, but synthetic beings."

Luckily, deep under the fundations of the arcologies, our researches have managed to find abandoned ruins belonging to our civilization that will allow us to gain a deeper understand of our culture and history.
