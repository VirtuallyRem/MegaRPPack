primitive_fix.200.bronze.desc:0 "After the initial hardships in trying to get the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName] to even understand us, we were able to successfully teach them the fundamentals of metallurgy and agriculture, as well as the basic legislative framework to establish permanent, sedentary communities and enter the §YBronze Age§!. Many of them have already forgo their nomadic lifestyle and resettled into the small cities we help them build, while those haven't will soon follow their example after witnessing the oblivious benefits. Although they are still much, much far away from our technological level, they have made the first step on the road to space."
primitive_fix.200.bronze.a:0 "The birth of a civilization."

primitive_fix.200.iron.desc:0 "Thanks to our help, the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName] have aquired the ability to work sturdier metals and greatly expanded their civilization all throughout their homeworld, entering the §YIron Age§!. With their new tools they were able to increase their food production, as well as the size of their buildings, allowing their population to concentrate in larger urban centers. Although we have noticed several...violent usage of these new materials, we have managed to prevent the outbreak of any large-scale war between the various primitive factions that could threaten our efforts."

primitive_fix.200.medieval.desc:0 "In order to give the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName] an intellectual base from which to base further progress on, we helped design rudimentary contraptions that can quickly replicate their paper texts, so that a larger share of the population could access them. This widespread availability of knowledge greatly boosted their civilization and allowed them to enter the §YLate Medieval Age§!."

primitive_fix.200.renaissance.desc:0 "We have teached the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName] the segrets of chemistry and explosive compounds, allowing them to quickly dispose of natural obstacles to their expansion. At the same time, new weapons based around this technology have greatly destabilized the established political structure, leading to the appearence of centralized nationstates and standing armies as opposed to fortification-based local governments. These innovations, coupled with their increasing scientific and cultural sophisticacy, have allowed the primitives to enter the §YRenaissance§!".

primitive_fix.200.steam.desc:0 "We have given the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName] the means from which to build rudimentary steam engines that could increase their productivity tenfold, allowing them to enter the §YSteam Age§!. With this new technology, they were able to mechanize many menial jobs that previously required a large workforce and establish a starting point from which to build their future industrialization."

primitive_fix.200.industrial.desc:0 "With suble interventions here and there we were able to kickstart an industrial revolution among the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName], causing them to fully enter the §YIndustrial Age§!. Factories now dominate their citiscapes and the vast availability of food and medicines has caused their population to boom, however, the primitives' rapid growth has also caused a toll on their planet's ecosystem that we, unfortunatly, couldn't fully mitigate."
primitive_fix.200.industrial.ind:0 "The price of progress!"
primitive_fix.200.industrial.eco:0 "Sorry [FROMFROM.GetName]!"

primitive_fix.200.machine.desc:0 "We shared with the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName] blueprints for many technological solutions that they could incorporate into their devices, to increase their efficiency exponentially and allowing them to perform tasks that were previously tought impossible. With these innovations the primitives were able to build rudimentary flying machines and wireless comunication systems, among others, bringing their civilization to the §YMachine Age§!."
primitive_fix.200.machine.mach:0 "The Age of the Machine has begun."

primitive_fix.200.atomic.desc:0 "We have instructed the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName] on how to harness the power of nuclear energy and expanded their understanding of physics in the process, granting them access to the §YAtomic Age§!. While we haven't, obliviously, suggested or even mentioned the possibility of using this knowledge for building weapons of mass destruction, it's highly likely that they will figure this out on their own eventually. We can only hope they will be wise enough to never use them."
primitive_fix.200.atomic.pac:0 "Who would be so stupid to build the means of their own destruction?"

primitive_fix.200.space.desc:0 "We have given the primitives of [FROMFROM.GetName] a glimpse of the knowledge necessary to establish a spacefaring empire, allowing them to launch their first, artificial satellites in orbit and sending manned missions to other planets of their solar system, marks of an §YEarly Space Age§! civilization. Even without our intervention, it's only a matter of time before they will discover faster-than-light travel and join us on the galactic stage."
